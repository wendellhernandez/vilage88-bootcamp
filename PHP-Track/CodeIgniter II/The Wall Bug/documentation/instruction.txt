Assignment: The Wall (Bug)

Objectives:
- To practice the Debugger tool in VSCode in finding possible causes of error.
- To have you familiar on errors and solutions that possibly you may encounter in the future.

Instruction: 
Using Debugger Tool, try to investigate the lines that are root cause of bugs specified in the list and correct it to make the whole web app functional.

These are the possible reasons of error in the codebase that should be fixed:

DONE
1. You may be using a function from a helper that is not loaded yet. (Ex. 'url', 'security')

DONE
2. You may be using a function from a model that is not loaded yet. (Ex. 'comment', 'message')

DONE
3. Encountering 403 (Forbidden) where form request is not allowed by the enabled CSRF Protection due to form's missing token. 

DONE
4. Calling a function but forgot to pass the required parameter/s. 

DONE
5. Missing form validation. (Ex. Input field 'email' should be valid, not null).

DONE
6. Being redirected to a missing page which caused by wrong route path. (You may check the routes.php)

DONE
7. You might be comparing values with different format. (Ex. Comparing a normal character string over the encrypted string). Check the model and see if you need to convert the string.

DONE
8. You might initialized a variable with incorrect, hardcoded value. (Ex. hidden input field is initialized to a normal string instead of an id).

DONE
9. The controller/model can't find the specific data from submitted form due to mispelled name in one of the form's input field.
 
Tips:
- Use breakpoints to highlight the lines you want to investigate and see if the program will go to it.
- Use 'Watch' feature in the Debugger tool to monitor the value of variable/s.
- Use 'Step Into' to dig through the called function. 
- Use 'Step Over' to go to next lines.

Goodluck and Happy coding!
