1.What is the benefit of learning Javascript?

- If you learn other backend programming first, you still need to learn Javascript frontend anyway. So
why not learn Javascript first. Javascript is a little bit Different but it still follows a lot
 of the C family syntaxes. itâ€™s also easy for someone who knows Javascript to ask other developers 
 for help, even if that developer is not that familiar with Javascript.

2.What type of applications can be built with Javascript?

You can do frontend, backend and mobile app using only one language.

3. Which programming language is good for beginners to learn (according to Michael's perspectives)?

- Javascript. You can create full stack web applications. As well as native mobile apps.
- Python. Easy to learn but you still need Javascript to make a full stack web app.
- PHP. Easy to build complex apps but in a crappy way.

4. Which programming language is not good for beginners to learn, as their first language (according to Michael's perspectives)?

- Java. Java is a lot stricter. Hard to make a complex app. You still need Javascript to make a full stack web app.
- C#. Very strict like Java
- C++. Most commonly used in simple apps. Can get very confusing for beginners.
- Ruby. Great language for experienced developers to write little code but harder to learn with.
- Swift. Hard for beginners to learn.
- Objective C. Even harder to learn than swift.

5. Study how the 5 core building blocks are implemented from one language to another.  
What are your observations?  Are they similar?  Different?  
Which of these programming languages are you already familiar with?

- They are mostly similar with little differences here and there. If you know how the structure of one language,
you can easily learn the other. But the way different languages approach OOP is quite different. But that is
not a problem for a developer with strong logics.
- Im familiar with PHP and Javascript

6. Anything else you've learned as you've read these articles and pondered about your situation?

- I was always confused how start programming. Where to start. How to start.
I thank hacker hero for giving me guidance on how to approach this questions.
